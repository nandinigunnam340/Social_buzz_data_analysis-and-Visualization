# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Internship Journey through Forage

## Project Overview
Welcome to my Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Internship project! I'm thrilled to share my journey of working on a project for our **client - Social Buzz**, a dynamic social media and content creation platform. Throughout this internship, I've had the exciting opportunity to analyze our client's content performance and provide valuable insights based on data analysis.

## Task 1: Understanding the Project ðŸ§ 

About the Client

**Objectives** - To start engagement with Social Buzz, Accenture is running a 3 month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following: 
- An audit of their big data practice 
- Recommendations for a successful IPO 
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling ðŸ§¹ðŸ“Š

**Objective**: My goal was to analyze content categories and determine the top 5 categories with the highest popularity based on reaction scores.

**Steps Taken**
- Cleaned the provided datasets: Reaction Types, Reactions, and Content.
- Merged the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Identified the [top 5 performing categories] based on total reaction scores.
  
## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling ðŸ“ŠðŸ“–

**Objective**: To choose data visualizations that effectively tell the story of our client's content performance.

**Steps Taken**
- Reviewed data analysis results to uncover key insights.
- Selected appropriate data visualizations to convey insights clearly.
- Created a professional [PowerPoint presentation] outlining key findings and recommendations.
  
## Task 4: Presentation to the Client ðŸŽ¥ðŸ’¼

**Objective**: Deliver a concise and informative presentation to our client and internal team members.

**Steps Taken**
- Reviewed data analysis results and selected impactful visualizations.
- Recorded a <10 minute video presentation to deliver the insights to the client and team members.

## Insights & Recommendations

1. From the data I found that Social Buzz had a total of 16 unique categories of posts across the dataset. This includes things such as Food, Science and
Animals.

2. There were 1738 reactions from just the Animal category alone! People obviously really like animals!

3. The most common month for users to post within was May, which had the most number of positive engagements.

4. From the analysis, the top 5 most popular categories of posts were Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology and Food in descending
order.

</p>

5. Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around **68624**. 

6. It was very interesting to see both Food and Healthy Eating within the top 5, it really shows
that Food is a highly engaging content category. 

7. Healthy Eating ranks slightly higher than Food, so perhaps the user base may be skewed towards healthy eaters and health-conscious people. This could be a signal to show the types of people that are using the platform, and they could use this insight to boost engagement even further. For example, Social Buzz could run a campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating brands to promote content.

8. It was also interesting to see Science and Technology too. This may suggest that people enjoy consuming "real-life" and "factual" content, and snippets of content that they can learn something from.
  
## Conclusion

This internship journey has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply data analytics and visualization skills in a real-world setting. I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to our client's success and to grow both personally and professionally during this internship at Accenture.
